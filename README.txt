TimeMachine MVP - Simplified Architecture

TimeMachine is a time-travel debugger for LangChain agents that records every AI decision with full context, 
allowing you to replay exactly what happened and test what would have happened with different settings. 
When your AI agent gives a wrong answer in production, instead of guessing why, you can replay that exact moment 
and see what GPT-4 would have said, or what would have happened with lower temperature - turning hours of debugging into seconds.

This project is designed to work on all types of agents, ranging from simple to complex.

WHAT YOU ACTUALLY NEED FOR MVP
-------------------------------

CORE FEATURES (Must Have)
-------------------------
1. Record LangChain agent decisions
2. Replay those decisions exactly
3. Test basic counterfactuals (different model/temperature)
4. Simple web UI to view recordings

WHAT TO CUT FROM MVP
--------------------
- Cold storage (not needed - users won't have 30+ day old data yet)
- Warm storage (probably not needed - SQLite can handle first few thousand users)
- Pattern detector (nice to have, not essential for proving value)
- Query engine (just use SQLite queries directly)
- Fancy analytics (save for later)
- Team collaboration (single user is fine)
- Compliance exports (enterprise feature)

MVP ARCHITECTURE (Simplified)
------------------------------

1. RECORDER
  - Simple LangChain callback handler
  - Captures: inputs, outputs, model config, timestamps
  - Stores in local SQLite database
  - Skip: tool calls, retrieved docs (add later if needed)

2. STORAGE
  - Just SQLite for everything
  - One table for decisions
  - One table for metadata
  - Auto-delete after 7 days (keep it simple)
  - ~1GB should handle thousands of decisions

3. REPLAY ENGINE (Simplified)
  - Store the exact prompt + model name + temperature
  - For replay: just call the same model with same inputs
  - Skip: model versioning, deterministic seeds (accept some variance)

4. BASIC COUNTERFACTUALS
  - Only support: change model (GPT-3.5 vs GPT-4)
  - Only support: change temperature
  - That's it - proves the concept

5. MINIMAL WEB UI
  - List view of recordings
  - Click to see details
  - "Replay" button
  - "Try with GPT-4" button
  - Simple before/after comparison

IMPLEMENTATION (2-3 WEEKS SOLO)
--------------------------------

Week 1: Core Functionality
- Day 1-2: LangChain callback handler
- Day 3-4: SQLite storage schema
- Day 5-7: Basic replay (call model again)

Week 2: Counterfactuals + API
- Day 1-2: Model swapping logic
- Day 3-4: Temperature adjustment
- Day 5-7: REST API with FastAPI

Week 3: Basic UI
- Day 1-3: List view of recordings
- Day 4-5: Replay interface
- Day 6-7: Polish and deploy

MINIMAL CODE EXAMPLE
--------------------
# recorder.py
from langchain.callbacks.base import BaseCallbackHandler
import sqlite3
import json
import uuid

class TimeMachineCallback(BaseCallbackHandler):
   def __init__(self, db_path="timemachine.db"):
       self.db = sqlite3.connect(db_path)
       self.current_decision = {}
       
   def on_llm_start(self, serialized, prompts, **kwargs):
       self.current_decision = {
           "id": str(uuid.uuid4()),
           "timestamp": time.time(),
           "input": prompts[0],
           "model": kwargs.get("invocation_params", {}).get("model_name"),
           "temperature": kwargs.get("invocation_params", {}).get("temperature")
       }
   
   def on_llm_end(self, response, **kwargs):
       self.current_decision["output"] = response.generations[0][0].text
       self.save_decision()
       
   def save_decision(self):
       # Save to SQLite
       pass

# replay.py  
def replay_decision(decision_id):
   # Load from DB
   decision = load_decision(decision_id)
   
   # Call same model with same params
   llm = ChatOpenAI(
       model=decision["model"],
       temperature=decision["temperature"]
   )
   return llm.predict(decision["input"])

def counterfactual(decision_id, model=None, temperature=None):
   decision = load_decision(decision_id)
   
   # Override params
   if model:
       decision["model"] = model
   if temperature:
       decision["temperature"] = temperature
       
   # Run with new params
   llm = ChatOpenAI(
       model=decision["model"],
       temperature=decision["temperature"]
   )
   return llm.predict(decision["input"])

WHAT SUCCESS LOOKS LIKE
-----------------------
- Developer installs package
- Adds one line to their code
- Runs their agent
- Opens localhost:8000
- Sees their agent decisions
- Clicks replay, sees it work
- Tries "What if GPT-4?", sees different result
- "Holy shit this is useful"
- Shares with team
- Upgrades to paid tier

WHAT TO PUNT TO V2
------------------
- Multi-agent chains
- Tool call recording  
- Document retrieval tracking
- Advanced counterfactuals
- Pattern detection
- Team features
- Cloud storage
- Compliance stuff

WHY THIS WORKS AS MVP
---------------------
1. Solves real problem (debugging production AI)
2. Simple enough to build in 2-3 weeks
3. Impressive enough for demo
4. Clear upgrade path to full version
5. Validates core hypothesis (replay is valuable)

QUICK SANITY CHECK
-----------------
- Can you record decisions? ✓ (LangChain callbacks)
- Can you replay them? ✓ (Just call API again)
- Can you test alternatives? ✓ (Change params and call)
- Can users see value? ✓ (Simple UI)
- Can you ship in <1 month? ✓ (Yes with focus)

SKIP THE COMPLEXITY, SHIP THE VALUE

# TimeMachine Implementation Summary

## What's Built

**Recording System**: Captures every node execution in LangGraph agents. Records input state, output state, timing, and errors. Works automatically without changing your agent code.
**Database Storage**: Saves all execution data to SQLite database. Can query runs by ID, date, or status. Handles complex LangChain objects like messages and custom state.
**Integration Options**: Three ways to add recording - decorator on your agent function, context manager around execution, or direct graph wrapping.
**Replay Engine**: Re-runs recorded executions with different settings. Can modify AI model, temperature, prompts, or any state values.
**Counterfactual Analysis**: Systematic "what if" testing. Compare different models, test temperature ranges, try prompt variations, sweep parameter values.
**Scenario Comparison**: Ranks different approaches by how much they change outputs. Identifies best and worst performing modifications.

## How Someone Uses It
**Add decorator, run agent**: Developer adds `@timemachine.record()` to their agent function and runs it normally. All executions get saved automatically.
**Pick execution, test alternatives**: Point to any recorded execution and ask "what if I used GPT-4 instead?" System replays with different settings and shows the differences.

## Data Flow
**Recording**: Decorator wraps StateGraph.compile(), instruments each node with wrapper that captures input/output state before/after execution. State gets serialized to JSON and stored in SQLite with execution metadata.
**Replay**: Engine loads execution from database, deserializes state, applies modifications (model/temperature/prompt changes), re-executes original node function, calculates output difference score, returns comparison results.

- Only works with mock data, not real LLM API calls
- Can't analyze multiple executions at once
- No way to browse or search old recordings
- Can't export data for external analysis
- No connections to external DBs
- No performance monitoring
- No webapp

## Next Steps

**Real Testing**: Validate with actual OpenAI/Anthropic API calls instead of test data.
**Missing Tools**: Build execution browser, batch analysis, search, export, and cleanup features.
**Web Interface**: Create visual interface for exploring recordings and running experiments.
